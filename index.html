        <h2 class="section-header">What interests you?</h2>

        <p>
            Though I'm a computer science major, I developed a deep interest in philosophy throughout highschool. I liked the process of unpacking layers of complexity in everyday things, and I knew, that whether conscious of it or not, my view of the world is influenced by countless hidden assumptions. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I saw philosophy as a way to challenge those assumptions. It was immediately obvious that it's basically impossible to reach any satisfying conclusions, but maybe over time I could learn to ask better questions and even gain some small measure of control over them. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I also started to combine interests. My focus within computer science is game development, and I soon became interested in the ways that the aesthetic qualities of games can illustrate philosophical concepts, and how video games fit within the context of fiction and art. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-header">What do you already know or suspect about AI or Ethics?</h2>

        <p>
            I have some limited knowledge of how machine learning works, and relatively little about ethics, but there are several ethical questions surrounding AI that I suspect I will enjoy discussing. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm particularly drawn to questions of who owns creative work that AI produces, because I feel that such questions make us confront the way we view our own capacity for creative thought. Setting aside legal issues of copyright, how fundamentally different is an algorithm's creative process from our own? Do our brains not simply sift through information and combine it in ways we call “creative”? After all, Picasso himself said “Good artists copy, great artists steal.” And if it is the case that our brains are not all that different from machines, then beyond our current practical limitations, to what extent could a machine theoretically… have rights?
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-header">What have you learned already in the first class, especially anything that challenged you or surprised you?</h2>

        <p>
            This first week of class, I was able to reflect on the pros and cons of the ethical theories we covered. I learned a lot more about the rationale behind virtue ethics as described in Driver's book (particularly the role that “practical wisdom” plays), and I also familiarized myself with Hume's version of virtue ethics.        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, when we were evaluating ethical theories, I noticed that there seems to be a general conviction that the majority of people are morally good. When we find that perfectionist moral virtues are unattainable, or that classical Utilitarianism is unrealistically demanding when taken to its logical extreme, it feels like a flaw in the theory. It's a natural conviction to have, but I'm curious about ways that particularly a Utilitarian might respond by simply accepting that everyone is evil to varying degrees, and the potential flaws this position might have. (I've read a little bit about Peter Singer before and I believe this is along the lines of what he argues, but I'm interested to learn more).
